    <p>
      Chomp is a game which isplayed on a rectangular grid, such as squares of a
       candy bar, and it is a multiplayer game.
    </p>
    <p>  The lower or upper left square is considered "poison". <br />Players take turns picking
      a square.<br>
      With each choice, all squares above or below and to the right of the
      picked square are no longer available --they are eaten.
      <p>The person forced
      to take the "poison" square loses.
